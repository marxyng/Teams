<h2>the ultimate</h2>
<p>Constantly working my hardest to become the best.  Non-stop lifting weights along with the constant conditioning makes life for a day exhausting.  
    It's all <span>about</span> the things you do to become the best, to become the ultimate.

    <h2> The day it all happened</h2>
        <p>The <span>day</span> was thanksgiving day when everything happened.  It started off regular until after thanksgiving when I met up with all my friends.  We 
        went to the mall.  oh! I forgot before the mall we all agreed to get some alcohol.  Lets say they got the strong stuff.  The brand started with a T.  
        It was vodka and extremely strong.  Lets say after thanksgiving dinner, the day was very eventful.

<h2>If only they knew</h2>
    <p> If they only knew who I was truly.  I wonder <span>how</span> they would feel and look at me.  How much would they judge me.  Interesting how people will say 
        one thing, but do another.
